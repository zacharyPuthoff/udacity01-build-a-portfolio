// gonna try a little javascript in conjunction an image processing script
// that I found called "primitive"; it makes low-low-low size svg image
// files out of a jog by using shape ID and placement; the idea is to
// load them first, and then once the page finishes loading, use javascript
// to load up the high resolution, larger size pictures; possibly step
// by step for a cool affect
